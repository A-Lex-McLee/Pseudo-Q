The Syntax of Sudoku Grids: Infrastructure

Sudoku is really fun -- but it's also really hard, in fact, it is NP hard.
This does not merely concern the solving of actual Sudoku puzzles, but also the grid architecture as a whole, as observed e.g. in the attempt to generate a random (valid) Grid. 
This repository is part of a side project of mine called "The syntax of Sudoko grids" (even though some might prefer 'geometry instead of 'syntax'). It provides the basic architecture to instantiate, generate, manipulate and permute Sudoku grids
